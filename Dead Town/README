Dead Town Project Install Notes
-----------------

There's not actually anything external you need to install for the project to work.

iPhone- Please run this on a retina iphone as it is how I have tested it for the presentation.
        However, I will issue another update to make it work on non-hd devices. This is to do with
        the tile-maps on SD devices, I usually fix this as I go but I wished to focus my time
        on actual project content for the minute (as the minutes are few!) - or at least until the presentation is over.

Multiplayer - this was experimental and the last thing i came to look at. It only works on the level
              select screen as I have not coded it further. It would link well with my lvel API, the 
              latency is the problem!
              
TODOs - I have left a few TODO's here and there as there are many areas where I could improve the code
        but didn't have time.
        
Hopefully you enjoy the game!
